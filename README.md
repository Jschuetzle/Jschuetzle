My name is Jackson. I like coding. I like math. I like problem solving.

Currently doing CS undergrad at CWRU...planning on getting my masters in the future. Also a student-athlete there playing tennis. 

I'm interested in doing web developement + software engineering, but I like all types of subjects regarding math and computer science. AI seems cool. Low-level programming seems cool. Quantum computing seems cool. I'm up for anything.

Might make a matrix computation library soon or expand on my database library and extend it to other lower level languages.
