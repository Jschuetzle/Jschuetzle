<h3> About </h3>

My name is Jackson Schuetzle and I'm currently pursuing a masters degree for 2026 at Case Western Reserve University. I'm concentrating on software engineering and will have a minor in math. 

I'm interested in doing web developement + software engineering, but I like all types of subjects regarding math and computer science. AI seems cool. Quantum computing seems cool. I'm up for anything.

Might make a matrix computation library soon or expand on my database library and extend it to other lower level languages.
